## 2. Remarks from Mark
_Welcome! Thank you so much for coming._

_Turns out, it's kinda a big deal to be asked to officiate a wedding ceremony._

_After David asked me to do this, I really had no idea where to start. I began bringing it up with various people in my life to try to get a sense of what is required here. And that resulted in some better, and some worse, advice on what makes a good wedding. Maybe the best was from Aunt Linda who passed on the advice she received about her own wedding, which was that you need to remember that this is a show: this is the Anja and David show --- And it needs to be planned and executed like a show, with a narrative arc, rising action, and a climax._

_This appealed to me because if we think of the wedding as a show, it puts the focus on the audience. A show is FOR the audience, in this case you all who are here today. The whole point of this wedding venture, I think, is to do it in front of people who matter to David and Anja. That means YOU have all the power here. Most especially Grandma. YOU are the witnesses who affirm the marriage. And take the significance of of the ceremony with you. And there's really no power vested in me; the power of this thing is really vested in YOU, the audience._

_Conveniently, this really lets me off the hook for what at first seemed like a tremendously grave responsibility for this whole thing._

_Not entirely, of course. I'm still stuck with the role of narrator, or maybe story-teller. And I sort of struggled with this --- here's the problem: the first rule of telling a good story is to NOT give away the ending. You have to pique the audience's curiosity, give them a bunch of clues, and only slowly reveal the significance of the clues. That's where the pleasure of hearing a story comes from: the hints of mystery, the audience's desire to find out what happens._

_Well, you might begin to see the problem here: at a wedding, we all KNOW what's going to happen! The ending is already given away. There's no plot twists here, no jump scares, no surprises really, hopefully. And I thought: maybe that's what a good wedding needs: something like the part of the movie Jaws where the camera is half in the water, and sneaking slowly up on a swimmer, and the music is really slow because the tension is only starting to build..._

_So I thought more about Jaws. I thought: how can a wedding be more like Jaws?_

_But then, Jaws is a movie that is almost 50 years old now. I have no memory of the first time I saw it. But I still love that movie. David and I have probably seen it a hundred times, but I'll watch it again with anyone any time you like. And no matter how good the tension-building effects --- the music, the camera angles, the slow reveal of the shark --- no matter how good the experience is for a first-time viewer, there's gotta be something more to that movie. Something that makes it special enough that you can watch it 50 times and still enjoy it._

_So this is something we do in our family: we watch the movies we like over and over again. Even though we know every line in "Star Trek II: Wrath of Khan" every camera angle, every reaction shot --- we'll still want to watch it at least once a year. And I realized: well, that's an indicator of a really good story too --- even when there's no mystery or curiosity left to the story because you've seen it so many times, there's a pleasure in the anticipation of the familiar, isn't there? You enjoy it BECAUSE you know what's coming rather than because you don't know what's coming. You look for your favorite parts, and you feel satisfaction to find out it's just as good as the last time you saw it. Maybe, in some way, better, because now you know that your favorite movie wasn't just some passing fancy --- not just the latest special effects or topical jokes --- they are movies that have stood the test of time._

_And I thought: well if it works for Jaws, maybe that's how a wedding works too: we all get the satisfaction of a familiar story told over again. We know what the good parts are and that they are inevitably coming to us. We're all sitting here in anticipation that nothing unexpected will happen. And I don't think there are going to be any surprises today --- though if there are, then I encourage you to enjoy the plot twist!_

_And --- forgive me for this --- maybe we can push this metaphor even further. Maybe it's more than just the wedding ceremony, maybe a lot of the best marriages are founded on that kind of anticipation of the familiar. If you are still finding anticipation, satisfaction, and reassurance in the same person after decades, what more could you ask from a relationship? So I hope you find that in your marriage Anja and David._ 

But I can't leave it there. The story-teller part of me also hopes that your marriage is more like your experience when you read Lord of the Rings for the first time: a super-long, exciting, page-turner of epic proportions. Like maybe this is just the beginning of the story, and you are just reading the first couple of pages here at this wedding. Just getting to know these characters David and Anja. And they are just getting to know each other, really. Then there is a whole lifetime ahead of them to get the rest of the story arc down. I hope it will be one full of twists and turns and surprises. And seriously: not all good ones. It's a better story if people have to overcome adversity, right? But putting aside some of the more experimental fiction in the world, mostly we want to see the characters we love to successfully clear the plot twists and obstacles and come out on top._ 

_So that's what I wish for you David and Anja... a really good story with lots of excitement and surprises. And also a story that you keep coming back to and finding comfort in. That, I think, is kinda everything a marriage ever could be. I hope it's yours._

## 6. Fisherman's knot
1. Mark says: _David and Anja have decided that a fitting symbol of their marriage will be an attempt to literally tie the knot. The knot they will be attempting is known as a 'fisherman's knot' which has the characteristic that the more you pull on the ends, the tighter it gets. A metaphor for marriage... get it?_
