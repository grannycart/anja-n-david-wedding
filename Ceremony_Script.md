## Remarks from Mark
_Welcome! Thank you so much for coming._

_Turns out, it's kinda a big deal to be asked to officiate a wedding ceremony._

_After David asked me to do this, I really had no idea where to start. I began bringing it up with various people in my life to try to get a sense of what is required here. And that resulted in some better, and some worse, advice on what makes a good wedding. Maybe the best was from Aunt Linda who passed on the advice she received about her own wedding, which was that you need to remember that this is a show: this is the Anja and David show --- And it needs to be planned and executed like a show, with a narrative arc, rising action, and a climax._

_This appealed to me. As long as it is a good show, it's successful, no matter what else happens, right? I think it also emphasizes that there's really no power vested in me, the power of this thing is really vested in YOU, the audience. The whole point of this venture today is to do it in front of people who matter to David and Anja. YOU have all the power here. Most especially Grandma. YOU are the witnesses who affirm the marriage. And take the significance of of the ceremony with you._ 

_Conveniently, this really lets me off the hook for the grave responsibility for this whole thing._

_Not entirely, of course. I'm still stuck with the role of narrator, or maybe story-teller. I sort of struggled with this --- here's the problem: the first rule of telling a good story is to NOT give away the ending. You have to pique the audience's curiosity, give them a bunch of clues, and only slowly reveal the significance of the clues. That's where the pleasure of hearing a story comes from: the hints of mystery, the audience's desire to find out what happens._

_Well, you might begin to see the problem here: at a wedding, we all KNOW what's going to happen! The ending is already given away. There's no plot twists here, no jump scares, no surprises really, hopefully. And I thought: maybe that's what a good wedding needs: something like the part of Jaws where the camera is half in the water, and sneaking slowly up on a swimmer, and the music is really slow because the tension is only starting to build..._

_So I thought more about Jaws. I thought: what can I do to make this wedding more like Jaws?_

_But then, Jaws is movie that is almost 50 years old now. I have no memory of the first time I saw it. But I still love that movie. I've probably seen it a hundred times, but I'll watch it again with you any time you like. And no matter how good the tension-building effects --- the music, the camera angles, the slow reveal of the shark --- no matter how good the experience is for a first-time viewer, there's gotta be something more to that movie. Something that makes it special enough that you can watch it 50 times and still enjoy it._

_So this is something we do in our family: we watch the movies we like over and over again. Even though I know every line in Star Trek II: Wrath of Khan, every camera angle, every reaction shot --- I still want to watch it at least once a year. And I realized: well, that's an indicator of a really good story too --- even when there's no mystery or curiosity left to the story, there's a pleasure in the anticipation of the familiar, isn't there? You enjoy it BECAUSE you know what's coming rather than because you don't know what's coming. You look for your favorite parts, and you feel satisfaction to know it's just as good as the last time you saw it. Maybe, in some way, better, because now you know that your favorite movies weren't just some passing fancy --- not just the latest special effects or topical jokes --- they are movies that have stood the test of time._

_And I thought: well if it works for Jaws, maybe that's how a wedding works too: we all get the satisfaction of a familiar story told over again. We know what the good parts are and that they are inevitably on their way. We're all sitting here in anticipation that nothing unexpected will happen. And I don't think there are going to be any surprises today --- though if there are, then I encourage you to enjoy the plot twist!_

_And I further thought: well if it works for Jaws and for wedding ceremonies, then maybe the same thing applies to marriage itself? And maybe it does. Maybe some marriages thrive on that anticipation of familiarity. Nothing wrong with that._ 

_But another possibility is this is just the beginning of the story, and you are just reading the first couple of pages here at this wedding. Just getting to know these characters David and Anja. And they are just getting to know each other, really. They have a whole lifetime ahead of them to get the rest of the story arc down. I hope it will be one full of twists and turns and surprises. And seriously: not all good ones. It's a better story if people have to overcome adversity, right? But putting aside some of the more experimental fiction in the world, mostly we want to see the characters we love to successfully clear the plot twists and obstacles and come out on top. And that's what I wish for you David and Anja... a really good story._

## Fisherman's knot
* Mark says: _David and Anja have decided that a fitting symbol of their marriage will be an attempt to literally tie the knot. The knot they will be attempting is known as a 'fisherman's knot' which has the characteristic that the more you pull on the ends, the tighter it gets. A metaphor for marriage... get it?_
