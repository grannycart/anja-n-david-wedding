title: Anja & David Wedding: Ceremony Script
---


## Ideas for things to say:
* I had suggested to David that the most ideal person to officiate their wedding would be hero to us all, Weird Al. I guess Weird Al wasn't available, so you got me instead.
* David said Weird Al might not have the gravitas for a wedding. I'm not sure I do, but gravitas is what this is all about, isn't it?
	* It's the latin word for weight, or heaviness. And these things before us are certainly that.
	* You could almost imagine holding them in your hand
* In the art of storytelling, maybe the most basic tenet is that you give the reader a bunch of clues, but only slowly reveal the significance of those clues.
	* A lot of stories have a wedding in them, usually tagged on to the end in the happily-ever-after part of the denoument.
	* But without getting too meta here, the wedding itself is a story or a show, right? We're giving you clues, and building to a climax here.
	* Unfortunately... you already know the ending of this show!
	* (so can we do something to surprise everyone?)
	* If anything goes wrong here... well, surprise! Plot twist.
	* Maybe it's just not a surprise. Maybe it's like one of your favorite movies that you have see hundreds of times (Back to the Future, Indiana Jones) and you just revel in the familiarity of it. It's good BECAUSE you know what's coming. You're anticipating it -- and you also know it's GOING to be good, right?
	* (Or do you say) But maybe that's the wrong way of looking at it. Maybe this is just the beginning of the story, and you are just reading the first couple of pages here. Just getting to know these characters David and Anja. And they are just getting to know each other, really. They have a whole lifetime ahead of them to get the rest of the story arc down. I hope it will be one full of twists and turns and surprises. And seriously: not all good ones. It's a better story if you have to overcome adversity, right? But putting aside some of the more experimental fiction in the world, mostly we want to see the characters we love overcome adversities and come out on top. And that's what I wish for you David and Anja... a really good story.
* Im really here just as a story-teller, or a narrator. There's no power vested in me. If anythin, the power is vested in YOU the audience. (so this is how I can get out of the grave responsibility of this thing rewally.) The whole point of this venture is to do it in front of people who matter to dvid and anja, right? so YOU have all the power here. You're the ones who witness and affirm this thing, make it real, and take the signficane of it with you.
