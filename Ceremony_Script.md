## Remarks from Mark
_Welcome! Thank you so much for coming._

_Turns out, it's kinda a big deal to be asked to officiate a wedding ceremony. After David asked me to do this, I of course started bringing it up with various people in my life to try to get a sense of what is required here, with some better and some worse advice on what makes a good wedding. Aunt Linda passed on advice she received about her own wedding, which was that you need to remember that this is a show: this is the Anja and David show --- And it needs to be planned and executed like a show, with a narrative arc, rising action, and a climax._

_This appealed to me. As long as it is a good show, it's successful, no matter what else happens, right? I think it also emphasizes that there's really no power vested in me, the power of this thing is really vested in YOU, the audience. The whole point of this venture today is to do it in front of people who matter to David and Anja, right? YOU have all the power here. YOU are the witnesses who affirm this thing, and take the significance of it with you._ 

_Conveniently, this really lets me off the hook for the grave responsibility of this thing._

_Not entirely, of course. I'm still stuck with the role of narrator, or story-teller. I sort of struggled with this --- here's the problem: the first rule of telling a good story is to NOT give away the ending. You have to pique the audience's curiosity, give them a bunch of clues, and only slowly reveal the significance of the clues. That's where the pleasure of hearing a story comes from: the hints of mystery, the desire to find out what happens._

_Well, you might being to see the problem here: we all KNOW what's going to happen at a wedding. The ending is already given away. There's no plot twists here, no jump scares, no surprises really, hopefully. And I thought: maybe that's what a good wedding needs: something like the part of Jaws where the camera is half in the water, and sneaking slowly up on a swimmer, and the music is really slow because the tension is only starting to build..._

_So I though more about Jaws. I thought: what can I do to make this wedding more like Jaws?_

_But it dawned on me then that Jaws is movie that is almost 50 years old now. I have no memory of the first time I saw it. But I still love that movie. I'll watch it again with you any time you like. So the thing about Jaws is that no matter how good the effect of the story-telling was for a first-time viewer, there's gotta be something more to that movie than just good bread-crumbing._

_This, of course, is something we do in our family: we watch the movies we like over and over again. Even though I know every line in Star Trek II: Wrath of Khan, every camera angle, every reaction shot --- I still want to watch it at least once a year. And I realized: well, that's a part of a really good story too, right? Even when there's no mystery or curiosity left to the story, there's a pleasure in the anticipation of the familiar, isn't there? You enjoy it BECAUSE you know what's coming rather than because you don't know what's coming. You look for your favorite parts, and you feel satisfaction to know it's just as good as the last time you saw it. Maybe, in some way, better, because you know now that your favorite movies weren't just some passing fancy, they have stood the test of time._

_And I thought: well if it works for Jaws, maybe that's how a wedding works too. You all get the satisfaction of a familiar story told over again. I don't think there will be abu surprises, though if there are then I encourage you to enjoy the plot twist!_

_And I further thought: well if it works for Jaws and for wedding ceremonies, then maybe the same thing applies to marriage itself? And maybe it does. Maybe some marriages thrive on the anticipation of familiarity. Nothing wrong with that._ 

_But maybe this is just the beginning of the story, and you are just reading the first couple of pages here. Just getting to know these characters David and Anja. And they are just getting to know each other, really. They have a whole lifetime ahead of them to get the rest of the story arc down. I hope it will be one full of twists and turns and surprises. And seriously: not all good ones. It's a better story if you have to overcome adversity, right? But putting aside some of the more experimental fiction in the world, mostly we want to see the characters we love overcome adversities and come out on top. And that's what I wish for you David and Anja... a really good story._

## Fisherman's knot
* Mark says: _David and Anja have decided that a fitting symbol of their marriage will be an attempt to literally tie the knot. The knot they will be attempting is known as a 'fisherman's knot' which has the characteristic that the more you pull on the ends, the tighter it gets. A metaphor for marriage... get it?_
