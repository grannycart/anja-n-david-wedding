title: Anja & David Wedding General Notes
---



## Things to make sure get taken care of:
* [ ] have remarks fully written out by end of June (D&A will have vows done by then too)
* [ ] Who is ushering people to sit down: delegation
* [ ] PA system?
	* no power
	* experimenting with Dad's power rig

## Run of show: (shooting for 20 minutes) things to make sure get taken care of
1. Processional:
	* [ ] who is on the dais? (besides me; DJ ready in place; PA system at front)
	* Some groupings of people for epicness (parentals, aunts on Anja's side)
	* children of the bubbles 
		* [ ] (someone to herd them by this point in the song)
	* Then David and Anja walk in together
2. Remarks from Mark
	* Whatever you feel like saying is good; however long or short or sweet or sour (hopefully not too sour) will be good. We trust you. If, however, you would like some input from our end, or if you would like to run it by us beforehand that is fine too. 
	* [ ] write my stuff before hand -- send to Anja for translation
3. a few short readings (max 3):
	* Will ask Monika to read a Hermann Hesse poem or some other short and sweet German poem (Rilke maybe) 
	* We were thinking of asking Becci to do a reading -- ask her for something she wants to do
	* Poem from Lord of the Rings (Ted) 
4. I dos
	* Do you, Anja, take David to be your husband?
	* Do you David, take Anja to be your wife?
5. exchange of rings + Vows: We were thinking about saying a short and sweet nice thing about each other, 
	* both in English and in German.
	* [ ] who has the rings?
6. Fisherman's knot:
	* [ ] make sure to have rope (Brian Caruso); practice 
	* keep holding the knot for the smooch
7. you may smooch (start music):
	* We've reached the part of the ceremony where you may now smooch
8. pronouncement and presentation
	* music: love keeps lifting me higher -- present
	* By what little power I have in this world, I pronounce you husband and wife.
		* Surprise: you're now husband and wife.
	* It is my pleasure to present the married couple of Anja and David
	* music continues to rise and get louder
9. recessional during song:
	* [ ] Prep second song for long run-out

* Then champaign toast:
	* [ ] who is giving toast


## Ceremony logistics
* 100 people
* Outside, in gorge
* Epic and short Civilization 4 (the lord's prayer in swahili) for processional
	* Moss DJing 
* recessional -- music picked out by david
* reherssal run-through Friday night

## Ideas for things to say:
* I had suggested to David that the most ideal person to officiate their wedding would be hero to us all, Weird Al. I guess Weird Al wasn't available, so you got me instead.
* David said Weird Al might not have the gravitas for a wedding. I'm not sure I do, but gravitas is what this is all about, isn't it?
	* It's the latin word for weight, or heaviness. And these things before us are certainly that.
	* You could almost imagine holding them in your hand
* In the art of storytelling, maybe the most basic tenet is that you give the reader a bunch of clues, but only slowly reveal the significance of those clues.
	* A lot of stories have a wedding in them, usually tagged on to the end in the happily-ever-after part of the denouement.
	* But without getting too meta here, the wedding itself is a story or a show, right? We're giving you clues, and building to a climax here.
	* Unfortunately... you already know the ending of this show!
	* (so can we do something to surprise everyone?)
	* If anything goes wrong here... well, surprise! Plot twist.
	* Maybe it's just not a surprise. Maybe it's like one of your favorite movies that you have see hundreds of times (Back to the Future, Indiana Jones) and you just revel in the familiarity of it. It's good BECAUSE you know what's coming. You're anticipating it -- and you also know it's GOING to be good, right?
	* (Or do you say) But maybe that's the wrong way of looking at it. Maybe this is just the beginning of the story, and you are just reading the first couple of pages here. Just getting to know these characters David and Anja. And they are just getting to know each other, really. They have a whole lifetime ahead of them to get the rest of the story arc down. I hope it will be one full of twists and turns and surprises. And seriously: not all good ones. It's a better story if you have to overcome adversity, right? But putting aside some of the more experimental fiction in the world, mostly we want to see the characters we love overcome adversities and come out on top. And that's what I wish for you David and Anja... a really good story.
* I'm really here just as a story-teller, or a narrator. There's no power vested in me. If anything, the power is vested in YOU the audience. (so this is how I can get out of the grave responsibility of this thing really.) The whole point of this venture is to do it in front of people who matter to david and anja, right? so YOU have all the power here. You're the ones who witness and affirm this thing, make it real, and take the significance of it with you.
* Maybe keep the "story" theme throughout:
	* Not just that the wedding is like watching a movie you love over and over, but being married is too. You have to love the anticipation of the familiarity, rather than the surprise of a mystery.
	* When you get to the smooch: The climax! What you have all been waiting for.
	* And the denouement: the presentation.
