title: Anja & David Wedding General Notes
---

### Run of show: (shooting for 20 minutes)
1. Processional:
	* [ ] who is on the dais? (besides me; DJ ready in place; PA system at front)
	* Some groupings of people for epicness (parentals, aunts on Anja's side)
	* children of the bubbles 
		* [ ] (someone to herd them by this point in the song)
	* Then David and Anja walk in together
2. Remarks from Mark
	* Whatever you feel like saying is good; however long or short or sweet or sour (hopefully not too sour) will be good. We trust you. If, however, you would like some input from our end, or if you would like to run it by us beforehand that is fine too. 
	* [ ] write my stuff before hand -- send to Anja for translation
3. a few short readings (max 3):
	* Will ask Monika to read a Hermann Hesse poem or some other short and sweet German poem (Rilke maybe) 
	* We were thinking of asking Becci to do a reading -- ask her for something she wants to do
	* Poem from Lord of the Rings (Ted) 
4. Vows: We were thinking about saying a short and sweet nice thing about each other, 
	* both in English and in German.
	* [ ] experiment with this at silver bay
5. exchange of rings + I dos
	* [ ] where are the rings?
	* Do you, Anja, take David to be your husband?
	* Do you David, take Anja to be your wife?
	* ("I do." ring goes on the finger -- remember according to The Princess Bride it's not official unless you say 'I do') 
6. Fisherman's knot:
	* [ ] make sure to have rope (Brian Caruso); practice 
	* keep holding the knot for the smooch
7. you may smooch (start music):
	* We've reached the part of the ceremony where you may now smooch
8. pronouncement and presentation
	* music: love keeps lifting me higher -- present
	* By what little power I have in this world, I pronounce you husband and wife.
		* Surprise: you're now husband and wife.
	* It is my pleasure to present the married couple of Anja and David
	* music continues to rise and get louder
9. recessional during song:
	* [ ] Prep second song for long run-out

* Then champaign toast:
	* [ ] who is giving toast


## Things to make sure get taken care of:
* [ ] have remarks fully written out by end of June (D&A will have vows done by then too)
* [ ] Who is ushering people to sit down: delegation
* [ ] PA system?
	* no power
	* experimenting with Dad's power rig


## Ceremony
* 100 people
* Outside, in gorge
* Epic and short Civilization 4 (the lord's prayer in swahili) for processional
	* Moss DJing 
* recessional -- music picked out by david
* reherssal run-through Friday night
* Maybe keep the "story" theme throughout:
	* Not just that the wedding is like watching a movie you love over and over, but being married is too. You have to love the anticipation of the familiarity, rather than the surprise of a mystery.
	* When you get to the smooch: The climax! What you have all been waiting for.
	* And the denoumout: the presentation.
